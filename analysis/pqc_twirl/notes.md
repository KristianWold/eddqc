## Diluted Unitaires

We fit a diluted unitary to the retrieved spectrum to find experimental rank $r$ and dissipation strength $p$. Are we happy with the method?
We fit spectrum distance, that is, KL-esque metric on coated spectra. Why compare the retrieved spectrum with a synthetic diluted unitary with random U and random K, when we have the infinite size limit expression? 

Alternatively?

## Non-Markov

 (16 layer)x(8 layer)^-1 -> choi
 How many negative eigenvalues of the choi? How non-markovian, that is!
