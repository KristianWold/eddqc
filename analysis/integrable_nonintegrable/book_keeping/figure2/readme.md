hist_integrable_L=5.txt and hist_nonintegrable_L=10.txt contain the histogram density, a 200x200 grid, of the experimentally retrieved integrable and nonintegrable circuits. The bins are supposed to be uniformly from -1 to 1. The density is normalized such that sum(density)*4/40000 = 1.

To keep the scaling consistent with figure 1, we suggest setting a max of the color bar at 0.6, below the largest values of some of the histograms.

See /folders for example plots showing how they look with the color bar set to 0.6.
