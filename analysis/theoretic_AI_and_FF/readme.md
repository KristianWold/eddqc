hist_x_theory.txt contains the histogram density, a 200x200 grid, of theoretic data. The bins are supposed to be uniformly from -1 to 1. The density is normalized such that sum(density)*4/40000 = 1.

To capture the finer detials of FF41, we suggest setting a max of the color bar at 0.6, below the largest values of the histogram. To keep it consistent, it should be done for all the histograms.

See /folders for example plots showing how they look with the color bar set to 0.6.
