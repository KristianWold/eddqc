# Read Me

This folder contains the folders for the Zhejiang experiments. The folderrs are organized as follows:

## experiments

Collection of zips, codes and raw experimental results. 

## integrable

This folder contains notebooks for retrieving the quantum maps from the free-fermion and generic circuit Zhejiang experiments. From the retrieved maps, the spectra and CSR are computed and contrasted with numerical and theoretical predictions.

## pqc

This folder contains notebooks for retrieving the quantum maps from the parameteric quantum circuit Zhejiang experiments. The retrieved maps are used to compute the spectra. The ring-like spectra of the PQC are investigated, and Diluted Unitary models are fitted to the data to produce estimates of effective decoherence strength and rank.

## pqc_twirl

Same as `pqc`, but with data generated with Pauli twirling.

## retrieve_map

Preliminary attempt at retrieving map from first data

## spam

Analysis of the retrieved SPAM models
